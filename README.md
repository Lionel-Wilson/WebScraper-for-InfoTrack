# WebScraper-for-InfoTrack

---

## Purpose Of The App

The CEO from InfoTrack is very interested in SEO and how this can improve Sales. Every morning he
searches the keyword “land registry searches” in Google and counts down to see where and how many
times their company, www.infotrack.co.uk sits on the list. Seeing the CEO do this every day, a smart
software developer at InfoTrack decides to write a small application for him that will automatically perform
this operation and return the result to the screen. They design and code some software that receives a
string of keywords, and a string URL. This is then processed to return a string of numbers for where the
resulting URL is found in Google. For example “1, 10, 33” or “0”. The CEO is only interested if their URL
appears in the first 100 results.
